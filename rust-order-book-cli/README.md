# rust-order-book-cli

Simple implementation of a [order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) using Rust. This project used to be part of it's own [repo](https://github.com/CodeLutetium/rust-order-book) but I am moving it here as I will be turning the original repo into a larger project.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) is installed on your machine.

To run code, simply run 

```sh
cargo run
```
